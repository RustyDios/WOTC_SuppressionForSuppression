[h1]What is This?[/h1]
This is a simple mod that makes it so you can't use suppression if you are suppressed.
Should apply to friend and foe, for direct and area suppression.

Should work mid campaign, but not mid tactical.

[h1]Config[/h1]
The list of abilites that can't be used under suppression is config editable in [b]XComGame.ini[/b]
By default this is all the suppression abilities I could find.

[h1]Credits and Thanks[/h1]
Thanks to [b]PreConceptor[/b] on the discord for the idea/request
Thanks to all the modders that have made awesome suppression abilities!
